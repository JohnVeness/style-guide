This repository contains the following document: 

- [**The Raspberry Pi Style Guide 2.0**](https://github.com/raspberrypi/style-guide/blob/master/style-guide.md): this guide should be used when producing written material for Raspberry Pi Ltd, and may be supplemented by reference to the *New Oxford Style Manual*, *Hart's Rules*, and the *New Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors*.

This guide is, inevitably, not exhaustive, and may be added to over time. Please be sure to refer to the version of the guide in this repository, which is considered to be the definitive record, and not to any forked copy you may have.
